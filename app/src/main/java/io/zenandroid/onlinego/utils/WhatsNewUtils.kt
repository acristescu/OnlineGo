## What's new

- Stats page. 
Thanks to popz73 for the contribution!
In addition to your personal record, you can check the stats of your opponents by tapping their name/profile picture on the game screen.

## Fix

- Hotfix for occasional crash introduced in the last version

## Previous version

You can now play GO offline against the KataGO AI. This is still experimental and I've only really tested it on a Samsung Galaxy S9+. Please raise an issue including the phone's model [here](https://github.com/acristescu/OnlineGo/issues) if it does not work for you.

The bot should play at around 3-4 dan, so most people would require a handicap for an enjoyable game. In the future we're hoping to implement a way to "dumb down" the bot in the style of the Katrain app.
