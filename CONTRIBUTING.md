Getting Started
---

You will need to create a Google FireBase Project and generate a `google-services.json` file to successfully build the project. 

1. Login to [console.firebase.google.com](console.firebase.com)
2. Create a Project with any name (doesn't matter) what it is
3. Uncheck the sharing settings for analytics data and create the project. <br>

    You should now be at the Project page in the Firebase Console 

4. Press Android icon
5. Press `Register App` after setting the following:

    `Package Name: io.zenandroid.onlinego`
    > It's the `applicationId` found in `app/build.gradle` 

    `App Nickname: anything you want`
    > It is just a user friendly way to identify it in the Firebase Console

    Omit the debug signing cert 

6. Download the `google-services.json` file and put it in the `app/` folder in Android Studio

You can now build/run the project.
